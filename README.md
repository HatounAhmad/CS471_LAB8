# Lab 8: Django Queries and Aggregation

In **Lab 8**, we explored various aspects of **Django ORM** to interact with the database. The lab tasks focused on:

1. **Using the `Q` operator** for complex queries with filters.
2. Filtering books by price, edition, and string matching in the title/author fields.
3. **Sorting** the results by title.
4. Performing **aggregation** to calculate statistics such as the total price, average price, and more.
5. Exploring **multi-model queries** by linking students with their associated addresses through foreign keys.
